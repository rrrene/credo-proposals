# Proposals for Credo

This repo collects proposals for [Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo), the Elixir code analysis tool with a focus on code consistency and teaching.

## Why this repo?

With the introduction of [Credo Plugins](https://github.com/rrrene/credo#plugins), users are now able to tap into Credo's execution pipeline and implement basically any functionality they desire.

But that does not mean that Credo's core features aren't up for debate.
In fact, this repo is specifically for these discussions challenging the status quo.

Have a better idea for how checks are executed? Tell us.

Have a vision how plugins could do even more in the future? Don't keep that to yourself.

Want to propose a new standard check? Don't be a stranger, we're using [issues](https://github.com/rrrene/credo-proposals) to keep track of proposed features.
